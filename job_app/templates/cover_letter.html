      <p>Dear <input type="text" name="hr_name" contenteditable="true"
        value="{{ hr_name|default:'HR NAME' }}">,<br>
        with this motivation letter I would like to underline my interest at working for the company
       <input type="text" name="company" contenteditable="true" value="{{ company|default:'COMPANY NAME' }}">.
      </p>
      <p>My total professional experience is 4 years, plus academical experience while
  obtaining my degree in Information Technology. During my studies I worked for a French company
  VDOM Box Research. After half a year, I got a promotion from Student to Junior Developer, and one year later
  I was working as a Python Developer and Manager of Technical Writers Team. During this time I learnt about GUI, Web,
  Multi-Platform and Server Development. One of the projects developed in the company I presented as my Thesis.
      </p>
      <p>After graduation, I did an internship in the company NEC (Heidelberg, Germany), where I worked in the project
    Smart Grid on an algorithm for Distributing solar Engergy in  multi-user Electric Systems.
    This work was completed 3 month earlier than planned, and I got involved in another project -
    development of Web Application for maintaining Energy Comissioning and Resource Consumption.
      </p>

        The last year I've been working part-time as a Python Developer for the company CueSoft
  (Freiburg, Germany), where I have been responsible for the development of Web Applications (both server-side and client-side).
  In parallel I worked as a Hardware/Software Specialist for the company ITS-Pfeiffer, consulting customers and implementing
  Hardware/Software solutions for different types of Servers. Apart from that, I invested time in my personal development -
  studying Psychology as my second Bachelor, learning German, and doing my own small projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my personal skills, I'm easily adapting in a new environment and able to apply my knowledge in
  different areas. I have strong analytical skills and can efficiently work on few tasks at the same time. I'm motivated
  to learn and grow both professionally and personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm looking for a full-time job as a Software Engineer.
